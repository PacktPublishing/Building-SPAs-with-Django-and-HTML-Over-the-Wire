## Instructions and Navigations
All of the project files are organized into folders. For example, Chapter01.

The code will look like the following:

```
function goToPreviousPage(event) { 

    const newData = { 

        "action": "list messages", 

        "data": { 

            "page": getCurrentPage() - 1, 

        } 
    }; 
```

**Following is what you need for this book:**

The HTML over WebSockets approach simplifies single-page application (SPA) development and lets you bypass learning a JavaScript rendering framework such as React, Vue, or Angular, moving the logic to Python. This web application development book provides you with all the Django tools you need to simplify your developments with real-time results.

With the following software and hardware list you can run all code files present in the book (Chapter 1-8).

We also provide a PDF file that has color images of the screenshots/diagrams used in this book. [Click here to download it](https://packt.link/2q526).
